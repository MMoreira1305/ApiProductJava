Hi, in this project I used some dependencies found in poom.xml. Also, I used VSCODE for code styling and management, along with Maven, Java JDK 17, Spring Boot 3.2.1, MySql, Hibernate, Lombok, Http Protocol.

Soo, lets check the frameworks and LibraryÂ´s i used.

Maven: Package and project manager, just like Gradle, it does the job of joining dependencies and making the project work in conjunction with spring boot, seeing annotations and managing them.

Spring Boot: With this framework, which is one of the most used in the world, it does the process that makes my code uncomplicated, putting annotations where I don't need to do manual processes, also with Spring Web I can create routes and use the HTTP protocol, so , along with Spring Jpa for database access.
    - Used Spring Web, Spring Jpa

MySql: Relational Database for storage the informations about products.

Hibernate: Data transfer of what was sent by the client to the server (Database), being able to also create versions of my bank, but I didn't enable it in this project.

Lombok: This dependency was used to take that very verbal part out of Java, streamlining the way I do Getters and Setters, as well as HashCode, Equals, and constructors. More information about the library on the official website.
